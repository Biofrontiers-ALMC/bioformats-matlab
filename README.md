# Bioformats Image Toolbox

Welcome to the Bioformats Image Toolbox!

The Bioformats Image Toolbox provides a way to read microscope files (such as
Nikon's ND2 format) into MATLAB. The toolbox implements a MATLAB class to use the [Bio-Formats Image
Package](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/) Java library.

### Prerequisites

  - MATLAB R2016b or newer (it is highly likely that an earlier version
    will work).
